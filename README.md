# Challenge 7

For this Challenge assignment, I created: A Jupyter notebook that contains an analysis of the ETF data that a SQL database stores, professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations and a screenshot or video of the web application that was created by deploying a Jupyter notebook via the Voil√† library. 
It was challenging as SQL is still very new to me.
